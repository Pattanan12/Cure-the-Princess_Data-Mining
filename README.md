# Cure-the-Princess_Data-Mining
Project 2 of ITCS453 Data Mining

In this project aim to engage in a practical data mining task using a real-world dataset. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in various stages of the data mining process, including data pre-processing, model building, and evaluation. The project begins with a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand its characteristics and gain insights then select two classification algorithms that are suitable for the dataset based on its nature and problem requirements. If necessary, the dataset will be pre-processed to address any data quality issues. The Orange data mining software will be used to build and evaluate models using the selected algorithms. The performance of the classifiers will be assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, which helps determine their effectiveness in generalizing to new data. By completing these tasks, this project has objective in gain practical skills in data analysis, algorithm selection, data pre-processing, model building, and performance evaluation within the context of a real-world dataset and the Orange data mining tool.
